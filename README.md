# Physics-Sandbox

This was made for Mac, With C++, Using GLUT ( OpenGL Utility Toolkit )
It was Extreamly helpful using OpenGL to create 2d and 3d graphics.

# Downloading the source

### If you're **NOT** on a mac...
* Download Any IDE
* Copy the main.cpp from the repo
* Compile using any prefered librarries

### If you're using a mac
* Clone the repo: 
- *git clone https://github.com/Maddox-Werts/Physics-Sandbox.git*
* Open the ***.xcodeproj*** file.

I belive that's it if you're using a mac,
Just open Main.cpp, click run and BAM!
If it's not working, try going into the add frameworks
page, add a framework for OpenGL and GLUT and you're done!
